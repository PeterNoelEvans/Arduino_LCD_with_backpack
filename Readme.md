### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### 1. **Incorrect I2C Wiring**
   - **Problem**: If the SDA and SCL pins are not connected properly or mismatched, the scanner will not detect any devices.
   - **Solution**: Ensure the connections are correct for ESP8266:
     - **SDA** (Data Line): Connect to **D2** (GPIO4).
     - **SCL** (Clock Line): Connect to **D1** (GPIO5).
     - Ensure the I2C device is connected to **3.3V** (not 5V) and **GND**.


#### 2. **Incorrect Device Address**
   - **Problem**: The I2C device might not respond due to an incorrect address.
   - **Solution**: Find an I2C scanner to confirm.

#### 3. **Software Issues**
   - **Problem**: The ESP8266 might not initialize the `Wire` library correctly.
   - **Solution**: Add the following lines before calling `Wire.begin()` in `setup()`:
     ```cpp
     Wire.begin();
     ```

#### 4. **Serial Monitor Configuration**
   - **Problem**: If the baud rate in the Serial Monitor does not match the one in your code (`115200`), the output may be garbled or unreadable.
   - **Solution**: Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE and set the baud rate to `115200`.

#### 5. **Defective I2C Device**
   - **Problem**: The I2C device might not be working or connected properly.
   - **Solution**: Test the device with another known working microcontroller or I2C scanner.

#### 6. **Power Supply Issues**
   - **Problem**: The device may not receive adequate power from the ESP8266.
   - **Solution**: Check the jumpers, wiggle the jumpers, change the jumpers.

### Debugging Tips:
1. Check the wiring and ensure no loose connections.
2. Run the scanner without any connected devices to ensure it reports “No I2C devices found” (baseline behavior).
3. If no devices are found even after troubleshooting, try using another I2C device to confirm the ESP8266 and scanner are functioning properly.
